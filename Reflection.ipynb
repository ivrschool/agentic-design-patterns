      "\n",
      "The `merge_sort` function takes a list of elements as input and recursively divides it into two halves until each half has one or zero elements (i.e., is already sorted). The `merge` function then merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted list.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Base case**: If the input list has one or zero elements, it is already sorted, so the function returns the original list.\n",
      "2.  **Divide**: The input list is divided into two halves, `left_half` and `right_half`.\n",
      "3.  **Conquer**: Each half is recursively sorted by calling the `merge_sort` function.\n",
      "4.  **Merge**: The two sorted halves are merged into a single sorted list using the `merge` function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Time Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Best-case time complexity: O(n log n)\n",
      "*   Average-case time complexity: O(n log n)\n",
      "*   Worst-case time complexity: O(n log n)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Space Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The space complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because the algorithm creates temporary lists to store the sorted halves.\n",

      "The provided implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Python is well-structured, readable, and correctly implements the divide-and-conquer approach. However, there are some minor improvements that can be suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Input Validation**: Add input validation to the `merge_sort` function to ensure that the input is a list. This can be done using the `isinstance` function.\n",
      "2.  **Type Hints**: Add type hints for the function parameters and return types to improve code readability and enable better static type checking.\n",
      "3.  **Docstring Improvements**: While the docstrings are well-written, they can be improved by adding more details about the algorithm, its time and space complexity, and any assumptions made by the function.\n",
      "4.  **Variable Naming**: Some variable names, such as `arr`, can be more descriptive. Consider renaming them to `input_list` or `elements` for better clarity.\n",
      "5.  **Example Usage**: The example usage can be expanded to demonstrate more scenarios, such as sorting lists of different sizes, sorting lists with duplicate elements, and sorting lists with negative numbers.\n",

       "\n",
       "1.  **Base case**: If the input list has one or zero elements, it is already sorted, so the function returns the original list.\n",
       "2.  **Divide**: The input list is divided into two halves, `left_half` and `right_half`.\n",
       "3.  **Conquer**: Each half is recursively sorted by calling the `merge_sort` function.\n",
       "4.  **Merge**: The two sorted halves are merged into a single sorted list using the `merge` function.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Time Complexity\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Best-case time complexity: O(n log n)\n",

       "\n",
       "*   The space complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because the algorithm creates temporary lists to store the sorted halves."
