       "The time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm is O(n log n), and the space complexity is O(n).

       "3.  **docstring formatting**: The docstring for the `merge_sort` function, but it could be formatted better. You can use the triple quotes (`\"\"\"`) to create a multiline docstring and format it using reStructuredText or Markdown.\n",
       "4.  **Code Comments**: While the code comments are good, there could be more comments explaining the logic behind certain parts of the code. This would make the code more readable and understandable for others.\n",

      "\n",
      " The provided implementation of the merge sort algorithm is correct and well-structured. However, there are a few minor improvements that can be suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Type Hints**: Add type hints for the function parameters and return types to improve code readability and enable better static type checking.\n",
      "2. **Docstrings**: While the docstrings are generally good, consider adding a `Raises` section to document any potential exceptions that may be raised by the functions.\n",
      "3. **Error Handling**: The `merge_sort` function does not handle the case where the input is not a list. Consider adding a check at the beginning of the function to raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a list.\n",
      "4. **Variable Naming**: The variable names are generally good, but consider using more descriptive names for the indices in the `merge` function, such as `left_ptr` and `right_ptr`.\n",
      "5. **Example Usage**: The example usage is good, but consider adding more test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs.\n",
